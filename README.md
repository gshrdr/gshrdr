## Hello!
- Iâ€™m currently building my online portfolio: [gavinshr.com](https://www.gavinshr.com)   
- I'm learning the following web-development technologies: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, & Three.JS
- You can reach me via my [contact form](https://www.gavinshr.com/#contact)  

### Note:
- My GitHub contributions graph shows when I began working on my website portfolio and I decided to make a serious commitment to commit & track all of my code via GitHub. Before Dec. 2021 I worked on my projects via local backups. Going forward I plan on sticking with GitHub for easier version control, cloud backups and making my code open-source.
