## Hello!
- Iâ€™m currently building my online portfolio: [gavinshr.com](https://www.gavinshr.com)   
- You can reach me via my [contact form](https://www.gavinshr.com/#contact)  

### Technical Writing

- [How To Code And Publish Your First Website In 2022 With No Prior Experience](https://medium.com/@shrader.gavin/how-to-code-and-publish-your-first-website-in-2022-with-no-prior-experience-e5facba050e9)

### Note:
- My GitHub contributions graph shows when I began working on my website portfolio and I decided to make a serious commitment to commit & track all of my code via GitHub. Before Dec. 2021, I worked on my projects via local backups. Going forward I plan on sticking with GitHub for easier version control, cloud backups and making my code open-source.
