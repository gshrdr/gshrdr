### Hello!
- Iâ€™m currently building my online portfolio: [gavinshr.com](https://www.gavinshr.com)   
- I'm learning the following web-development technologies: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, & Three.JS
- You can reach me via my [contact form](https://www.gavinshr.com/#contact)  

- Note: My GitHub contributions graph shows when I began working on my website portfolio and I decided to make a serious commitment to commit all of my code. Before that I worked on miscellaneous projects sporadically, often with only local copies. Going forward I plan on sticking with GitHub for easier version control, cloud backup, open-sourcing my code, and eventually moving on to contributing to other open source projects.
