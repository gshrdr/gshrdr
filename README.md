## Hello!
- Iâ€™m currently building my online portfolio: [gavinshr.com](https://www.gavinshr.com)   
- I'm learning the following web-development technologies: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, & Three.JS
- You can reach me via my [contact form](https://www.gavinshr.com/#contact)  

### Note:
- My GitHub contributions graph shows when I began working on my website portfolio and I decided to make a serious commitment to commit & track all of my code via GitHub. Before Dec. 2021, I worked on my projects via local backups. Going forward I plan on sticking with GitHub for easier version control, cloud backups and making my code open-source.

### Future Plans (Things I'm Interested In):
- Finishing my blog, publishing content routinely and setting up a newsletter
- Building more side projects on my website, such as a JavaScript TileMap based terrain generator & evolution simulator
- Starting a YouTube channel where I teach coding + document the projects I'm working on 
- Learning Web 3.0 decentralized technologies 
- Experimenting with audio synthesis through code, generating music programmatically 
- Learning more about 3D graphics rendering in a browser, building a 3D simulation
- Experimenting with AI/ML technologies
- Building [another](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/gavin-shrader/id1319656496) iOS application 
- Taking my future profits from web development, buying land in the forest and planting a bunch of trees
